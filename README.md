# hello-world

Hi there!

I am April. Turning 22 this coming April 8, 2021.
I'am introvert, which means I preferred to be alone. I am more productive when working inside my room.
I fancy computers since I was on First year Highschool.
But then I didn't have the chance to take the PCHS a course that was offered at the Vocational School that I study.
After graduating highschool, I work at the market due to financial problem.
On 2018, I came to my home town because a statecollege was built and it offers my dream course, and the most important thing is it's FREE.
But then I am one semester late that makes me an irregulars student.
I am currently studying at OMSC - Lubang Campus.
I'm now a third year student, taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technlogy.
I wanted to learn different programming language.
And to share what i can offer even though I am not great at explaining.
That is the reason why I am here.
